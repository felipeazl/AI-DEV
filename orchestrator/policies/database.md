# Database policy

- Production is read-only by default.
- Destructive operations (`DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, destructive migrations, mass updates,
  permission changes) require human approval.
- Every migration must be validated in a non-production environment first.
- LLM-generated SQL goes through the `database-safe` skill before execution.
- An LLM is never the last safety barrier.
